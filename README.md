This is a fork of pianobar that includes the ability to autosave songs
as they are played. To enable this functionality, add a save_dir parameter
to the config file:

~/.config/pianobar/config
```
save_dir = ~/music/pianosave/
```

Each station will be saved in a separate directory. Songs are saved in AAC
format.
